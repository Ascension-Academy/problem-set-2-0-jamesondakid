# Arrays in C
In this assignment, please write a C program that works with an array of color names.

## Your job
1. Create a C program that declares an array containing at least five color names (these should be strings).
2. Write a loop that goes through each color in the array.
3. For each color, print a message that shows:
   - The position of the color in the array (starting from 1)
   - The name of the color at that position

## Example
Your program should print an answer that looks like this:
```
Array position 1 contains red
Array position 2 contains blue
Array position 3 contains green
Array position 4 contains yellow
Array position 5 contains purple
```

## Requirements
- Use an array to store the color names. (5 points)
- Use a loop to iterate through the array. (10 points)
- Format your output exactly as shown in the example. (5 points)
- Include comments in your code to explain what each section does. (5 points)

## Bonus Challenge
For extra credit:
1. Allow the user to input the color names instead of having them pre-defined in the array.
2. After printing the colors, ask the user to enter a number, and then print the color at that position.

Feel free to use our class's Codespaces for your work. You won't need the CS50 library for this assignment unless you're trying the bonus challenge.
